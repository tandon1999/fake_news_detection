# The Greek Fake News Dataset

The Greek Fake News (GFN) dataset is comprised of real and fake news written in the greek language, and can be used to train text classification models, as well as other NLP tasks. The dataset was created based on the following methodology. First of all, real news items were collected from a number of reputable greek newspapers and websites. I added news from a variety of topics, mostly focusing on politics, the economy, the COVID-19 pandemic and world news. To identify fake news articles, I consulted [Ellinika Hoaxes](https://www.ellinikahoaxes.gr/), a greek fact-checking website that has been certified by the [International Fact-Checking Network](https://www.poynter.org/ifcn/) (IFCN). A sample of news items verified to be false were also added to the dataset. After that process was completed, the resulting dataset was used to train the text classification model of the Greek Fake News Detector application.
